# Reinforcement Learning Agent for Discrete State-Action Spaces

![Project Logo](link_to_your_logo.png)

## Overview

This project aims to solve the problem of navigating an agent through a discrete state-action space using three distinct techniques: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Dynamic Programming implemented in SQL using Snowpark. Each technique offers unique advantages and trade-offs, providing insights into their applicability based on the nature of the state-action space.

## Techniques

### 1. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)

DDPG was implemented to tackle the problem; however, it exhibited certain limitations. Despite its potential, DDPG proved to be the least effective among the three techniques. It required extensive training, often getting stuck in local minimums within the neural network, making it challenging to escape. While DDPG can be a powerful approach, caution is advised for scenarios with complex state-action spaces.

### 2. Deep Q-Network (DQN)

DQN, a simpler implementation as a neural network, demonstrated success in navigating the agent through the discrete state-action space. Its effectiveness, coupled with relative simplicity, makes DQN a favorable choice, especially in scenarios where a balance between performance and complexity is essential.

#### Graphs and Photos
Include visual representations of the DQN algorithm's performance, such as training curves or action-value estimates.

### 3. Dynamic Programming in SQL using Snowpark

The Dynamic Programming approach, implemented in SQL using Snowpark, emerged as the most efficient and quickest solution. This technique is well-suited for manageable state-action spaces, providing a reliable option for scenarios where speed is crucial. Dynamic Programming, while not as versatile as neural network-based approaches, proves to be highly effective in specific contexts.
